## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Scalability Principles

1. **Stateless Services**: No server-side state
2. **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more machines
3. **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic
4. **Caching**: Speed up reads
5. **Database Optimization**: Sharding, replication
6. **Async Processing**: Queue-based systems
7. **CDN**: Static content delivery
8. **Microservices**: Independent services

---

### CAP Theorem

**Choose 2 of 3:**
- **Consistency**: All nodes see same data
- **Availability**: System always responds
- **Partition Tolerance**: Works despite network failures

**Examples:**
- **CP Systems**: Banking, inventory (need consistency)
- **AP Systems**: Social media, DNS (need availability)
- **CA Systems**: Traditional RDBMS (network reliable)

---

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Latency** | Time to get response | < 100ms |
| **Throughput** | Requests per second | Depends on scale |
| **Availability** | Uptime percentage | 99.99% (4 nines) |
| **Consistency** | Data accuracy | Varies by system |

## 📊 Numbers You Should Know

### Latency Comparison

```
L1 cache reference:              0.5 ns
Branch mispredict:               5 ns
L2 cache reference:              7 ns
Mutex lock/unlock:               25 ns
Main memory reference:           100 ns
Compress 1K with Zippy:          3,000 ns = 3 µs
Send 1K over 1 Gbps network:     10,000 ns = 10 µs
SSD random read:                 150,000 ns = 150 µs
Read 1 MB sequentially from SSD: 1,000,000 ns = 1 ms
Disk seek:                       10,000,000 ns = 10 ms
Read 1 MB from network:          10,000,000 ns = 10 ms
```

### Storage

```
1 KB = 1,000 bytes = 10³ bytes
1 MB = 1,000 KB = 10⁶ bytes
1 GB = 1,000 MB = 10⁹ bytes
1 TB = 1,000 GB = 10¹² bytes
1 PB = 1,000 TB = 10¹⁵ bytes
```

**💡 Pro Tip:** System Design interviews test your thought process, not memorization. Focus on understanding trade-offs and communicating clearly!


---

## 💡 Simple Explanation (In Plain English)

System design is how you architect **large-scale software**: users, traffic, data, failures, and cost. Interviews ask you to clarify requirements, estimate scale, draw components (clients, load balancers, DB, cache, queue), and discuss **trade-offs** (SQL vs NoSQL, consistency vs availability). There is rarely one right answer—clear thinking wins.

---

## 🎯 Interview Quick Prep

### 1. What is a system design interview testing?

**Simple Answer:** Communication, requirement gathering, high-level architecture, deep dives on bottlenecks, and trade-offs—not memorizing buzzwords.

### 2. How start a design question?

**Simple Answer:** Clarify functional/non-functional requirements, scale (DAU, QPS, storage), constraints, then rough capacity math before drawing boxes.

### 3. What is CAP theorem?

**Simple Answer:** In a partition, you choose between Consistency (all nodes see same data) and Availability (every request gets a response). Partition tolerance is assumed in distributed systems.

### 4. Vertical vs horizontal scaling?

**Simple Answer:** Vertical: bigger machine, simpler, limit at hardware ceiling. Horizontal: more machines, needs load balancing and distributed data—standard for web scale.

### 5. Why mention trade-offs?

**Simple Answer:** Interviewers want to hear why you picked Redis, sharding, or async queues—and what breaks if traffic 10x overnight.
