## 💡 Simple Explanation (In Plain English)

- Advanced Java is the "under the hood" layer: JVM, GC, concurrency, patterns, functional style, and new language features.
- You are not just writing code — you are tuning performance, avoiding memory leaks, and designing thread-safe systems.
- Each subfolder is a deep dive; this README is your roadmap for senior-level interviews and production troubleshooting.
- Master one topic at a time (JVM → concurrency → patterns) rather than skimming everything at once.

## 🎯 Interview Quick Prep

### Q1: What areas does "Advanced Java" cover for senior roles?
**Simple Answer:** JVM internals (class loading, memory), garbage collection tuning, advanced concurrency (`ExecutorService`, `ConcurrentHashMap`), design patterns, functional APIs (streams, Optional), and modern features (records, virtual threads). Interviewers expect you to connect these to real production issues.

### Q2: How would you troubleshoot an OutOfMemoryError in production?
**Simple Answer:** Capture a heap dump, check GC logs, identify whether it is heap, metaspace, or native thread exhaustion, then use MAT or similar tools to find what objects dominate memory. Fix leaks (static collections, unclosed resources, ThreadLocal) or right-size heap and GC settings.

### Q3: When would you choose G1 GC vs ZGC?
**Simple Answer:** G1 is the default balanced choice for medium-to-large heaps with predictable pause targets. ZGC (or Shenandoah) targets very low pause times on large heaps where latency matters more than simplicity. Choice depends on heap size, SLA, and JDK version.

### Q4: Why learn design patterns as a Java developer?
**Simple Answer:** Patterns name recurring solutions (Singleton for one instance, Factory for creation, Strategy for swappable algorithms). They help you communicate design in interviews and avoid reinventing fragile structures in code reviews.

### Q5: What is the learning order recommended in this folder?
**Simple Answer:** Start with JVM internals, then concurrency, design patterns, functional programming, garbage collection, and finally Java 9–21 features. That order builds mental models before optimization and modern syntax.

**Must-know for interviews:** Tie answers to trade-offs (throughput vs latency, pattern vs YAGNI) and mention one tool you have used (JVisualVM, jstack, MAT).
